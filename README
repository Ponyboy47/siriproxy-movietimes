** This plugin will not work on anyone else's proxies because I have made certain additions to my proxy that allow me to do more with my plugins. I will share the code I have added to my proxy when I've worked the bugs out of it. **
Ask Siri for "Theater Showtimes" if you know which theater you will be going to but are not sure which movie.
Ask Siri for "Movie Showtimes" if you know which movie you want to see but are not sure which theater to see it at.
Ask Siri for "Movie times for (today|tomorrow|day of the week)" if you want showtimes for a movie in the future (for up to the next 3 days).
If you're in an area you are unfamiliar with then ask for "Movie Theaters" to see which are closest to you. *Locations must be turned on*
