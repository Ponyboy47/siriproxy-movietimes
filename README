** This plugin will not work on anyone else's proxies because I have made certain additions to my proxy that allow me to do more with my plugins. I will share the code I have added to my proxy when I've worked the bugs out of it. **
Ask Siri for "Movie Times" if you know which theater you would like to see the times for.
If you're in an area you are unfamiliar with then ask for "Movie Theaters" to see which are closest to you. *Locations must be turned on*
