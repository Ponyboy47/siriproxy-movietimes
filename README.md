Ask Siri for "Theater Showtimes" if you know which theater you will be going to but are not sure which movie. <br />
Ask Siri for "Movie Showtimes" if you know which movie you want to see but are not sure which theater to see it at.<br />
Ask Siri for "Movie times for (today|tomorrow|day of the week)" if you want showtimes for a movie in the future (for up to the next 3 days).<br />
If you're in an area you are unfamiliar with then ask for "Movie Theaters" to see which are closest to you. *Locations must be turned on*
